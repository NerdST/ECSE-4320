## Project Reports Location

Each project's lab report is available in both **PDF** and **Markdown** formats in its main directory.

* **Recommended:** Use the **PDF** version for viewing and submission, as it is the finalized format.
    * Example PDF files:
        * `Project1/Project1_report.pdf`
        * `Project2/Project2_report.pdf`
        * `Project3/Project3_report.pdf`
* **Source:** The original report files are now named **README.md** for better visibility on GitHub:
    * `Project1/README.md`
    * `Project2/README.md`
    * `Project3/README.md`

Both formats are kept up to date for reference.
